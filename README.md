# About
* This repository contains a simple app which is based on **WPF** and **C#** that implements MVVM architecture with custom user control items.
* You can track your spendings by date with your preferred currency symbol. New currencies can be added with desired symbols.
* To save data I used **Newtonsoft.Json** to serialize and unserialize saved data on the local disk.
